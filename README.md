# kisioresa-api

This is a project from the [Canal Hacke #4](http://www.canaltp.fr/Blog/Entry/id/128).

It aims at seeing the meeting rooms occupied to have a quick look at which room is available or not.

We use the [php-ews/php-ews](https://github.com/jamesiarmes/php-ews) lib to query the exchange server.

##Â Requirements

- PHP >= 5.5.9

## Install

- `composer install`

You will be asked to enter your login and password for your email account. This will be used to query the server to retrieve the meeting rooms.

The `booking_available_rooms` parameter is already filled by default, but you can update them as you want.

## Usage

You can run the server with the Symfony command: `bin/console server:start localhost:8000`

Then, you have two routes available:

### See details for a specific room

URL: `http:/localhost:8000/booking/room/{email}`

#### Response information for an available room

| Fields  | Type  | Information  |
|---|---|---|
| is_room_available  | boolean  | True if the room is available, false otherwise  |
| email_room  | string | The meeting room email (the same as you typed in the URL) |
| daily_availability  | string | A string composed of 48 digit. `0` means the room is available, `1` or `2` means the room is occupied |

#### Response information for an occupied room

| Fields  | Type  | Information  |
|---|---|---|
| is_room_available  | boolean  | True if the room is available, false otherwise  |
| email_room  | string | The meeting room email (the same as you typed in the URL) |
| daily_availability  | string | A string composed of 48 digit. `0` means the room is available, `1` or `2` means the room is occupied |
| current_meeting  | array | An array with the following keys: `organizer`: displays the meeting organizer name |
| suggested_rooms  | array | A list of suggested rooms represented by an array with the following keys: `places_count`: number of seats, `floor`: floor number, `label`: meeting room name, `email`: meeting room email. The suggested rooms are ordered by the number of seats (the `places_count` parameter), and by the nearest floor compared to your requested meeting room floor. |


### See the number of occupied rooms right now

URL: `http:/localhost:8000/booking/rooms/occupied_count`

The response is only an integer representing the number of occupied rooms
